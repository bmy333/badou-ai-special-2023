## This is my fourth assignment.
  In this project, it mainly includes the Canny edge detection algorithm and the use of PCA principal component analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the input data matrix. Among them, I have fully implemented the construction of Canny edge detection algorithm and PCA algorithm from scratch. Of course, to meet the needs of the vast majority of people, I have also directly called Python third-party library files to complete the corresponding tasks.
