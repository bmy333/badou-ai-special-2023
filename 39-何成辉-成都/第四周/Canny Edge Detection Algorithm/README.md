## Canny Edge Detection Algorithm
In the Canny edge detection algorithm document, I provided four Python files as follows:
* canny.py:It implements canny edge detection through interface tuning.
* canny_detail.py:Detailed Implementation of Canny Algorithm.
* canny_track.py:Canny edge detection: optimized program——Adjustable threshold range.
* sobel_laplace_canny.py:It compares edge detection in the x and y directions of the soft operator, Laplacian operator, and Canny operator, and displays their differences by drawing images.
